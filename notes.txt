use bool instead of ints
better argument names
makefile relink and a lot worse
maybe replace weird return values (like 1024) by just 1
why take an int if the value must be an uchar
do not skip the tests
should it crash when passing null, or return zero
optimize ft_is?? function by using bitwise operator
first check if lower than n, and then check if it's not zero, in this order (not done in the example ft_strncmp, ft_strnstr)
use valgrind to check memory error (out of range access)
ft_atoi double overflow but it's fine
in ft_substr, what if start is after the end of s
check the static function in ft_strtrim and ft_split
does ft_split require not empty str, like in piscine or not
todo: ft_itoa ft_putnbr_fd
verify that static function are only accessible in one file
what does const
does static variable are ok in the norm
how does static function translate in assembly
